# Automatic playlist generation
## Main idea
Get the list with recommended songs *from local library* based on a given track.  
Example (from [here](http://moretrackslikethis.com/)):
**Re: Your Brains by Jonathan Coulton** may give us the following  
(if all the tracks are in local media library):
 - Code Monkey by Jonathan Coulton
 - First of May by Jonathan Coulton
 - Carrot Juice Is Murder by The Arrogant Worms
 - The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny by Lemon Demon
 - Opening Band by Paul and Storm
 - Stress by Jim's Big Ego
 - I Am Cow by The Arrogant Worms
 - Business Time by Flight of the Conchords
 - Beelz by Stephen Lynch
 - If You're Into It by Flight of the Conchords
 - etc...

## Target prototype
Right now we are going to make a script prototype (probably Python one)
which uses some local folder with parsed songs and provide a schedule for futher tracks (may be plays them after that).
User can skip current song if he didn't like it (WTF).
